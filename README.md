TITLE- NOTICE APPROVAL MANAGEMENT PLATFORM

PROBLEM STATEMENT-
In large educational institutions, administrative processes such as approvals for leave applications, project proposals, event permissions, and official documents are still largely dependent on manual, paper-based workflows. These traditional methods require physical movement of files between multiple authorities, leading to frequent delays, inefficiencies, and lack of transparency.
Faculty members often face difficulties when concerned authorities are unavailable, resulting in pending approvals and missed deadlines. Additionally, there is no centralized system to track the real-time status of documents, which makes it hard to determine accountability or identify process bottlenecks. The reliance on physical files also increases the risk of document misplacement, duplication of effort, and unauthorized modifications.Many institutions continue to rely on outdated methods that slow down administrative operations and reduce overall productivity.
Therefore, there is a need for an automated, secure, and transparent workflow management system that enables online document submission, structured approval hierarchies, authenticated authorization, and real-time tracking. Such a system would eliminate manual dependencies, improve turnaround time, and bring efficiency and accountability to institutional approval processes.
